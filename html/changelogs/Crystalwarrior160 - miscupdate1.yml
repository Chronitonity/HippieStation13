# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - tweak: "Teeth are now stackable items! No longer will all 32 teeth sail off in an arc in a single lucky hit with a fork!"
  - tweak: "Now the lisp depends on the amount of missing teeth. Examine text tells you how much teeth are you missing."
  - tweak: "The amount of teeth knocking out now depends on weapon's force. You won't be able to >punch< any more than ~7 teeth now unless you're hulk or something. Punching teeth out, however, is a better idea than to try to use a lower-brute weapon on them. Instead, go grab a toolbox or heck a fireaxe and apply it directly to the mouth for the biggest possible chance to knock dem teeth out."
  - tweak: "Made collapsed rollerbeds fit in backpacks."
  - tweak: "Improved 'dancing' (both people passive-grabbing each other) animation."
  - soundadd: "Added RIP AND TEAR sound effect to removing embedding items."
  - bugfix: "Fixed resisting grabs. You can now properly resist out of all grab types (except succesful choking (last grab stage) - you can't save yourself now)"
